# Project Introduction
Recommendation Engine has been one of most widely used user cases for AI and Machine Learning as the fast growth of Ecommerce and digital advertising. It is a good idea for Udacity to create this project so that audience new in this field has the opportunity to obtain practical experience with this model.

In this project, we will analyze interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations about new articles users will like. In addtion, the recommendation engine is also to shows the top articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

# Project details
The project is divided into the following 5 tasks.
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
 This step is to explore, clean and preprocess the data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.
### 2. Rank Based Recommendations
In this step, we find the n top articles ordered with most interactions as the top.
### 3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
Here we would like to go one further step to find users which are similar in terms of top articles they interacted. The top articles can then be recommended to the similar users. 
At the last of this step, given a new user, we want to find the top 10 recommended articles.
### 4. Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
This step is about another way of recommendation method, content based recommendation. It is required. If you are interested, please refer to other developers.
### 5. Matrix Factorization
In this part, we use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform.
