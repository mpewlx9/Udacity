# Dog Breed Classifier 
## Project Introduction
Welcome to the Dog Breed Classifier Project. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a machine learning model to detect the types of dog breeds or human for user provided images. Given an image of a dog, this model will identify an estimated dog breed. If the image is a human, the detector will be able to tell it is a human and the similar dog breed. If the image is neither a dog or a huma, the model is able to call out as well.
## Modeling Details
This is a complex model and can be divided into the following 7 steps:
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 6: Write your Algorithm
- Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

The details about each step can be found in file dog_app-Copy1.ipynb
## File Descriptions
- dog_app-Copy1.ipynb. This file has descriptions for each step, modeling code, and code output.
- 5 image files. These files are used to test the CNN model.
