# Dog Breed Classifier 
## Project Introduction
Welcome to the Dog Breed Classifier Project. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a machine learning model to detect the types of dog breeds or human for user provided images. Given an image of a dog, this model will identify an estimated dog breed. If the image is a human, the detector will be able to tell it is a human and the similar dog breed. If the image is neither a dog or a huma, the model is able to call out as well.
