# Stack Overflow Developers Survey 2017
## Project Motivation
This is the first project “Write A Data Science Blog Post” for the “Data Scientist Nanodegree” in Udacity training.

This project will get some insights from data survey_results by Stack Overflow Survey (2017) on the well being of the software engineers from Germany and how it is compared to United States. Three questions are to be answered: Question 1: Do software developers in Germany earn as much as their peers in United States? Question 2: Do software developers in Germany have higher career satisfaction than those in US? Question 3: Do software developers in Germany have higher job satisfaction than those in US?
